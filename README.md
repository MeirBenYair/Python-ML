# Machine Learning Project in Python

I used 2 sources of information. One with  products that returned to the store
And one only with the data and I need to predict how many products will be returned.
### Part 1:
Some analytical questions about the data. That made with Jupyter notebook
You can enter the file(part 1_solution.ipynb)

### Part 2:

 #### 1 - Data Collection
 * The quantity & quality of the data dictate how accurate our model is 
 #### 2 - Data Preparation
 *  Clean that which may require it (remove duplicates, correct errors, deal with missing values, normalization, data type conversions, etc.) 
 * Randomize data, which erases the effects of the particular order in which we collected and/or otherwise prepared our data 
 
 #### 3 - Choose a Model
 * I did a comparison between several models and got a high score for one of them and I used it.
 
 #### 4  What features are important
 * Check which features are important to the model.
 #### 5 score
 * After the whole process works the result I got is:
 ### 0.999818181818181818
 You can see the whole process the  file:(part 2_solution.ipynb)
